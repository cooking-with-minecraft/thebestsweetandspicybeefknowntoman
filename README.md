## the best sweet and spicy beef known to man... 
   here's the rough pattern of how it was made:
#### start:
+ non stick pan, medium heat with 1/8inch pour of sesame oil
#### side:
+ 1/2 cup rice added to 1 cup boiled water with dash of seseme oil, oregano, and thyme for 15m:42s
#### main prep:
+ thin strips (1/4inch fries) of top round beef, seasoned with ~2 teaspoons dizzy pig mediteranean dry rub, and 2 teaspoons kikioman soy sauce ... mixed in cold in bowl for 10 minutes while pan heated up
#### cooking order:
+ once pan is heated and beef seasoned thoroughly, add to oil and brown all all visible sides constantly moving beef (this takes about 10 minutes).
+ chop half yellow onion into 1/4inch pieces to match texture, add to browning beef (do not drain fat-liquids)
+ add healthy 2 tablespoons of hoisin sauce to pan and mix for a minute
+ add a healthy dab of ghost pepper sauce to pan (know your own spice preferences)
+ add a small spoon of duck sauce (apricot + fructose corn syrup) and mix for another minute
+ add 1/4 to 1/3 bag of shredded lettuce, and stir constantly to homogenize the flavors until rice timer beeps
